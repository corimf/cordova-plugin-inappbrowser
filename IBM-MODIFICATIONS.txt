Webview methods need to run on UI thread starting in Android 4.3

- Cordova RTC work item number: 31731
- Apache Cordova Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4858
- Markmail or Google Group reference: none
- Product PMR: none
- backport CB-4858 to this branch. Without it, starting in Android
  4.3 the InAppBrowser may fail to open, and calls to window.open for the 
  InAppBrowser would throw a Java exception.
